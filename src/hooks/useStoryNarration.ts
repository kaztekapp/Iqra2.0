/**
 * Listening to a story.
 *
 * The story is flattened once into a queue of sentence-sized utterances, each
 * remembering which block it came from. Playback is a single async loop over
 * that queue, and the loop is owned by a "run" number: starting playback
 * increments it, and any older loop that wakes up to find the number changed
 * returns without speaking or advancing.
 *
 * That is the whole defence against hearing something twice. Every control —
 * play, pause, skip, speed, changing chapter, leaving the screen — either
 * lets the current loop continue or supersedes it; nothing ever leaves two
 * loops running, and a superseded loop cannot advance the index it no longer
 * owns.
