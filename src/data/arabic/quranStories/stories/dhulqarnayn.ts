  summary: "Dhul-Qarnayn was a righteous and powerful king whom Allah established on earth and gave means to accomplish great things. He traveled to the far west and far east, dealing justly with all peoples. His greatest feat was building an impenetrable barrier of iron and copper to protect a vulnerable people from the corruption of Gog and Magog. Despite his immense power, he attributed everything to Allah and looked forward to the Day of Judgment.",
