  description: 'Young believers who fled persecution and slept for centuries',
  summary: "The story of the Sleepers of the Cave tells of young men who believed in Allah during a time of polytheism and persecution. Rather than compromise their faith, they fled to a cave where Allah caused them to sleep for over 300 years. When they awoke, they became a sign of Allah's power over life, death, and time - proof of resurrection. Their story, revealed in Surah Al-Kahf, teaches about maintaining faith under pressure, trusting in Allah's protection, and the reality of the resurrection.",
  lessons: [
    'Faith may require sacrifice and separation from society',
    'Allah protects those who trust in Him',
    'The resurrection is a certain reality',
    'Time is in Allah\'s control',
    'Youth devoted to Allah are especially honored',
    'Worldly power is temporary; faith is eternal',
