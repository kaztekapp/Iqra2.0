  description: 'A man of immense wealth from the people of Musa who was destroyed for his arrogance',
  summary: "Qarun (Korah) was an Israelite during the time of Prophet Musa who was blessed with extraordinary wealth - so much that the keys to his treasuries alone required a group of strong men to carry. Instead of being grateful and using his wealth for good, he became arrogant, attributing his success to his own knowledge and refusing to acknowledge Allah's favor. Despite warnings from his people, he persisted in his pride and was ultimately punished when Allah caused the earth to swallow him along with his dwelling and treasures.",
  lessons: [
    'Wealth is a test from Allah, not a sign of His pleasure',
    'Arrogance over blessings leads to destruction',
    'Everything we have is from Allah, not our own achievement',
    'The life of this world should not distract from the Hereafter',
    'Those who wish for worldly things often regret when they see the consequences',
    'True success is with Allah, not in material accumulation',
