  description: 'A parable about wealth, arrogance, and the fleeting nature of worldly success',
  summary: "This parable from Surah Al-Kahf tells of two men - one blessed with two magnificent gardens who became arrogant and denied the Hour, and his companion who reminded him to be grateful and humble. The wealthy man entered his garden boasting of his possessions and doubting resurrection. His companion warned him, but he persisted in pride. Allah destroyed the gardens, leaving the man wringing his hands in regret. This timeless parable warns against letting wealth lead to arrogance and denial of Allah.",
  lessons: [
    'Wealth can lead to arrogance if not paired with gratitude',
    'Always attribute blessings to Allah, not to self',
    'True friendship includes sincere advice, even if unwelcome',
    'The life of this world is temporary like vegetation',
    'Saying "Masha Allah, la quwwata illa billah" protects blessings',
    'What is with Allah is better and more lasting',
