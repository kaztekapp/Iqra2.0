  description: 'The mysterious guide who taught Prophet Musa profound lessons',
  summary: "Khidr was a righteous servant whom Allah blessed with special knowledge. When Prophet Musa wanted to learn from him, Khidr warned that Musa would not have patience for things he could not comprehend. Their journey together involved three seemingly unjust acts - damaging a boat, killing a boy, and repairing a wall without payment - each of which Khidr later revealed had divine wisdom behind it. This story teaches that Allah's wisdom often exceeds human understanding, and what appears harmful may be beneficial.",
  lessons: [
    "Allah's wisdom surpasses human understanding",
    'Patience is required when learning from those with more knowledge',
    'What appears harmful may be a hidden blessing',
    'True knowledge comes from Allah alone',
    'Even prophets have much to learn',
    'Divine decree operates beyond our perception',
