  description: 'The story of the two sons of Adam and the first murder in human history',
  summary: "The story of Habil (Abel) and Qabil (Cain), the two sons of Adam, represents humanity's first murder. Both brothers offered sacrifices to Allah - Habil's was accepted while Qabil's was rejected due to the conditions of their hearts. Consumed by jealousy, Qabil threatened to kill his brother. Habil's response was one of remarkable faith and nobility: he would not raise his hand even in self-defense, and he feared Allah. Despite this, Qabil killed his brother. A crow then taught him to bury the body. This story teaches the gravity of murder, the danger of unchecked jealousy, and the importance of sincere intentions.",
  lessons: [
    'Allah accepts only from the righteous and sincere',
    'Jealousy can lead to the worst of crimes',
    'Piety is not in the offering but in the heart',
    'Murdering one soul is like murdering all humanity',
    'Self-restraint in the face of aggression is noble',
    'Regret after sin can be a sign of conscience or mere worldly loss',
