  description: 'A wise man who gave timeless advice to his son',
  summary: "Luqman was a righteous man whom Allah blessed with profound wisdom. Though not a prophet, his wisdom was so significant that an entire surah of the Quran bears his name. His advice to his son covers the fundamentals of faith and character: monotheism, gratitude to Allah and parents, the certainty of accountability, establishing prayer, enjoining good, forbidding evil, patience in adversity, and humility in conduct. His teachings remain a perfect guide for parenting and moral education.",
