  description: 'A righteous man whom Allah caused to die for 100 years, then brought back to life',
  summary: "The story of Uzayr (Ezra) illustrates Allah's power over death and resurrection. Passing by a ruined town, Uzayr wondered how Allah could bring it back to life. Allah caused him to die for one hundred years, then resurrected him. His food and drink remained fresh, but his donkey had decayed to bones - which Allah then reassembled before his eyes. This miraculous experience was not a punishment for doubt, but a sign and lesson about resurrection that Uzayr was meant to witness and share.",

        translation: 'Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township which had fallen into ruin. He said, "How will Allah bring this to life after its death?" So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years; then He revived him. He said, "How long have you remained?" He said, "I have remained a day or part of a day." He said, "Rather, you have remained one hundred years. Look at your food and your drink; it has not changed with time. And look at your donkey; and We will make you a sign for the people. And look at the bones [of this donkey] - how We raise them and then We cover them with flesh." And when it became clear to him, he said, "I know that Allah is over all things competent."',
