  summary: "Prophet Yunus (Jonah), also called Dhun-Nun (The One of the Fish/Whale), was sent to the city of Nineveh in ancient Assyria. When his people initially rejected his message, he left them in frustration before receiving Allah's permission. He boarded a ship that was caught in a storm, and after lots were cast, he was thrown overboard and swallowed by a great whale. In the belly of the whale, in the depths of the sea, in the darkness of night, Yunus called out to Allah with one of the most powerful supplications in the Quran. Allah saved him, and he returned to his people - who had repented and believed, making them the only nation in the Quran to be saved from punishment through collective repentance.",
