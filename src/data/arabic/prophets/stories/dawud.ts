  summary: "Prophet Dawud (David) was a shepherd boy who rose to become both a prophet and king of the Israelites. He is famous for defeating the giant Jalut (Goliath) with a sling, establishing a righteous kingdom, and receiving the Zabur (Psalms). Allah blessed him with the most beautiful voice in creation - when he recited the Zabur, mountains and birds would join him in praise. Iron was made soft in his hands, allowing him to craft armor. He was known for his devotion to worship, fasting every other day, and his just rulings between people.",
