  summary: "Prophet Yahya (John the Baptist) was the miraculous son of Prophet Zakariya, born to elderly parents in answer to sincere supplication. His very name was unique - 'a name We have not assigned to any before' as Allah declared. From childhood, he was given wisdom and commanded to take the Scripture with strength. He lived an ascetic life, calling people to repentance and purity. He confirmed 'a word from Allah' - recognizing Isa as the Messiah. Yahya was martyred for speaking truth to power, becoming one of the greatest prophets, upon whom Allah sent peace at birth, death, and resurrection.",
