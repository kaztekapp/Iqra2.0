  summary: "Prophet Shu'ayb was sent to the people of Madyan (Midian), a prosperous trading community near the Gulf of Aqaba. They were known for cheating in business, giving short measure, and highway robbery. Shu'ayb, known for his eloquent preaching, called them to worship Allah alone and to deal justly in commerce. Despite his powerful arguments, they rejected him and were destroyed by an earthquake and a scorching day. Shu'ayb later welcomed Musa when he fled Egypt, and Musa married one of his daughters.",
