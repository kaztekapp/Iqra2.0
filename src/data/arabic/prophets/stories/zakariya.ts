  summary: "Prophet Zakariya (Zechariah) served as a priest in the Temple of Jerusalem and was chosen to be the guardian of Maryam (Mary), the mother of Isa. Despite his old age and his wife's barrenness, he never lost hope in Allah's mercy. When he saw how Allah miraculously provided for Maryam, he was inspired to pray for a child of his own. Allah answered his supplication and granted him a son, Yahya (John), a prophet who would prepare the way for Isa. Zakariya's story is one of unwavering faith and the power of sincere supplication.",
