  summary: "Prophet Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam, is the Messiah (Al-Masih) and one of the greatest prophets in Islam. Born miraculously without a father through Allah's command 'Be,' he spoke from the cradle defending his mother's honor. Allah granted him remarkable miracles: healing the blind and lepers, raising the dead, and creating birds from clay by Allah's permission. He confirmed the Torah and brought the Injil (Gospel). When his enemies plotted to kill him, Allah raised him to heaven alive. Muslims believe he will return before the Day of Judgment to complete his mission.",

      translation: "And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, 'O Isa, Son of Maryam, did you say to the people, Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?' He will say, 'Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen. I said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.'",

When Muslims defend Isa's true nature as a servant and messenger of Allah, they are defending what Isa himself taught. His story reminds us that miracles, no matter how impressive, point not to the prophet but to the One who grants them.",
