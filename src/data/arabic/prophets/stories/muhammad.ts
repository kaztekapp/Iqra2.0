  summary: "Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is the final messenger of Allah, sent as a mercy to all worlds. Born in Makkah in the Year of the Elephant (570 CE), orphaned young, he grew to be known as Al-Amin (The Trustworthy). At 40, he received the first revelation in Cave Hira, beginning 23 years of prophethood. He endured persecution in Makkah, migrated to Madinah, established the first Islamic state, and returned to conquer Makkah peacefully. His companions transformed from a persecuted few to the leaders of Arabia. His life (Sira) and teachings (Sunnah) provide the complete model for human existence. The Quran revealed to him remains unchanged as Allah's final guidance to humanity.",
