  summary: "Prophet Harun (Aaron) was the elder brother of Prophet Musa. Known for his eloquence and gentle nature, he was appointed as a prophet alongside his brother to support him in the mission to Pharaoh. While Musa received the revelation, Harun served as his spokesman and helper. When Musa went to Mount Sinai for forty nights, Harun was left in charge of the Israelites. Despite his efforts, they fell into worshipping the golden calf. Harun died before Musa, beloved by his people for his kindness and wisdom.",
