  summary: "Prophet Musa (Moses) is the most frequently mentioned prophet in the Quran, with his story told in over 70 chapters. Born during Pharaoh's persecution of the Israelites, he was miraculously saved and raised in Pharaoh's palace. After fleeing to Madyan and receiving prophethood at Mount Sinai, he returned to confront Pharaoh with signs and miracles. He led the Israelites out of Egypt, parted the Red Sea, received the Torah, and guided his people for forty years in the wilderness. His title 'Kalimullah' (Speaker with Allah) honors his direct conversations with God.",
