  summary: "Prophet Sulayman (Solomon), son of Dawud, inherited his father's kingdom and prophethood. Allah granted him unprecedented power: command over the wind, subjugation of the jinn, understanding of the language of birds and animals, and wisdom beyond any ruler. His kingdom was the greatest ever given to a human being. He built the Temple in Jerusalem using jinn labor, received the Queen of Sheba (Bilqis), and ruled with justice and gratitude. Despite his immense power, he remained a devoted servant of Allah, and his death - standing supported by his staff while jinn continued working - revealed how little even they understood of the unseen.",

      translation: '[Sulayman] said, "O assembly [of jinn], which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?" A powerful one from among the jinn said, "I will bring it to you before you rise from your place, and indeed, I am for this [task] strong and trustworthy." Said one who had knowledge from the Scripture, "I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you." And when [Sulayman] saw it placed before him, he said, "This is from the favor of my Lord to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful."',
