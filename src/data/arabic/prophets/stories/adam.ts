Adam saw one of them whose flash of light between his eyes amazed him, so he said, "O Lord, who is this?" He said, "This is a man from the last nations of your offspring called Dawud (David)." Adam said, "Lord, how long did You make his lifespan?" He said, "Sixty years." Adam said, "O Lord, increase his lifespan from my lifespan by forty years." When Adam\'s lifespan was ending, the Angel of Death came to him. Adam said, "Do I not have forty years remaining?" He said, "Did you not give them to your son Dawud?" Adam denied it, and his offspring denied. Adam forgot, and his offspring forgot. Adam sinned, and his offspring sinned.',
