  summary: 'Prophet Ismail was the firstborn son of Prophet Ibrahim and Hajar. As an infant, he was taken with his mother to the barren valley of Makkah by divine command. There, the miraculous spring of Zamzam emerged to save them. Ismail is most renowned for his supreme submission to Allah when he willingly agreed to be sacrificed by his father, an act of obedience that Allah rewarded by substituting a ram. Together with his father, he built the sacred Kaaba, and he became the ancestor of the Arab nation and ultimately of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.',
