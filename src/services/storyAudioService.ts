/**
 * Story narration — one sentence at a time, spoken exactly once.
 *
 * Two things make it sound like a person rather than a machine, both taken
 * from the approach proven in English 2.0:
 *
 *   1. ASK FOR THE GOOD VOICE. expo-speech with no `voice` uses the system
 *      default, which on both platforms is the small "compact" cut — the
 *      flat, clipped one that sounds synthetic. Both platforms also ship a
 *      far more natural neural voice that costs nothing to request and is
 *      simply never chosen by default. iOS labels those Enhanced/Premium;
 *      Android exposes network voices whose identifiers carry a variant tag.
 *      `bestVoice` scores the list and takes the best one.
 *   2. WHEN ONLINE, FETCH A NEURAL VOICE. Microsoft Edge's read-aloud
 *      service is free and keyless, and unlike the Google endpoint it has a
 *      real male voice as well as a female one. That matters because Apple
 *      exposes no good male voice to third-party apps at all: a stock iPhone
 *      offers the ancient Fred and a set of novelties, and the good ones are
 *      downloads most people never make. So the fetched voice is what makes
 *      the female/male choice mean anything, and it sounds the same on both
 *      platforms.
 *
 *      Do not make the device voice primary on iOS. That was tried, and it
 *      cost both quality and stability.
 *
 *      EVERY FALLBACK IS FEMALE. Edge is the only path that has a male voice
 *      worth listening to, so when it is unreachable the male choice cannot
 *      be honoured by anything else — and the phone's own male voices are
 *      the novelties this whole problem started with. Rather than hand a
 *      listener Fred, the ladder drops to Google's female voice, which is
 *      the one this app narrated with before and still sounds good, and only
 *      then to the device's best female voice. Hearing the other gender is a
 *      far smaller surprise than hearing a robot.
 *
 *   3. HOLD ONE ENGINE PER SESSION. It is chosen on the first sentence and
 *      only ever degrades. Deciding per sentence let one failed fetch swap
 *      the voice mid-chapter and swap back thirty seconds later.
 *
 * The playback contract is unchanged and strict, because it is what stops a
 * listener ever hearing a line twice:
 *
 *   `speak()` resolves EXACTLY ONCE, with why it ended.
 *
 * The queue advances only on 'done'. A generation counter makes a superseded
 * utterance unable to report anything at all, whichever path produced it.
